# Reinforcement Learning - An Introduction (Solutions)

This repository contains my solutions to the Exercises in the book "Reinforcement Learning - An Introduction (Second Edition)" by Sutton and Barto.

Solutions to the coding exercises are provided in Python (either as scripts or as Jupyter Notebooks).

If you would like to point out mistakes or discuss a particular solution, feel free to raise an issue :)

## Set up the environment

You can quickly setup the environment via Poetry (https://python-poetry.org). Simply execute `poetry install` in the root directory and you are good to go!

Execute `poetry shell` to activate the environment in a shell terminal.
